The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school

The school district summary will be a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

Total number of students
Total number of schools
Total budget

Overall passing percentage


To get the percentage of students who passed math and reading, we will write code to:

Determine the passing grade.
Get the number of students who passed math and reading in separate DataFrames.
Calculate the number of students who passed math and reading.
Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading.
To get the overall passing percentage, we will write code to:

Get the number of students who passed both math and reading in a DataFrame.
Calculate the number of students who passed both math and reading.
Calculate the percentage of students who passed both math and reading.
